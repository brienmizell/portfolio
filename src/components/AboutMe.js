      <h1>Hi, that guy above is me, Brien Mizell.</h1>
      <p>Why did I want to become a Software Engineer?</p>
      <p>
        The simple answer is that I love it. I love the thrill, and I love
        gadgets. I choose to be a Software Engineer to bring my ideas to life
        and help others understand how I think a better world looks.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a way, I have always been a programmer, per se. I always enjoyed
        programming my life and making edits so that my life would run smoothly
        and implementing life-hacks so that it could be as efficient as
        possible. Once introduced to computers, I would love searching for ways
        they could make my life simpler or more enriched. I am now writing those
        apps to help others live a better life and be more connected to the
        world around them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started programming CNC machines for cutting out precision parts to
        build tangible things, and I now use programming languages to help bring
        ideas to fruition in the virtual world.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love spending time with my dog, eating good food, spending time with
        great friends, drinking good beer, listening to good music, and watching
        sports. I'm a Georgia native, and I love everything <span>Atlanta</span>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        I take pride in the work I do and want to work for a company that will
        take the same pride in their employees. I don't shy away from hard work
        and long hours, because any job worth doing is worth doing right.{" "}
