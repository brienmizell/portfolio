      <h1>Hi, that guy above is me.</h1>
      <p>
        I went from programming CNC machines to cut out precision parts to build
        tangible things. I now use programming languages to help bring ideas to
        fruition in the virtual world. I have always been a programmer, per se.
        I always enjoyed programming my life and making edits so that my life
        would run as efficiently as possible.
